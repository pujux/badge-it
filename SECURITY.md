## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in service, please do the following:

- Do not create a public issue or pull request, as this could potentially expose the vulnerability to malicious actors.
- Instead, please email me at [julian@pufler.dev](mailto:julian@pufler.dev) with details of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. Please include the following information in your report:

    - A description of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited
    - Any other relevant information, such as the operating system and library versions you used to test the vulnerability

I take all security vulnerabilities seriously and will respond to your report as quickly as possible. Thank you for helping to keep this service secure.
